# Drawer

> Part of the Mekari Jurnal page-construction pattern set.
> Reference impl: [`index-template.vue`](../../app/pages/templates/index-template.vue) (filter drawer).
> See also [`FilterBar`](./FilterBar.md), [`Form`](./Form.md), [`Modal`](./Modal.md).

## Purpose

A right-side panel for the full filter set (or any secondary form that shouldn't
take over the whole screen). Composed from the `MpDrawer` parts.

## When to use

- **Filters** that don't fit the one-line filter bar (the canonical use here).
- Side forms / detail editors where context behind the panel should stay visible.

For destructive confirmation or a focused single-task dialog, use a [`Modal`](./Modal.md) instead.

## Markup

```vue
<MpDrawer
  :is-open="isFilterDrawerOpen"
  placement="right"
  size="sm"
  @close="isFilterDrawerOpen = false"
>
  <MpDrawerOverlay />
  <MpDrawerContent>
    <MpDrawerHeader>
      <span :class="drawerTitleClass">Filter</span>   <!-- fontSize: lg (16px) -->
      <MpDrawerCloseButton />
    </MpDrawerHeader>
    <MpDrawerBody>
      <div :class="filterDrawerFormClass"><!-- flex column, gap:4 -->
        <MpFormControl><MpFormLabel>Category</MpFormLabel><MpSelect …/></MpFormControl>
        <MpFormControl><MpFormLabel>Status</MpFormLabel><MpSelect …/></MpFormControl>
        <MpFormControl><MpFormLabel>Keyword</MpFormLabel><MpInput …/></MpFormControl>
      </div>
    </MpDrawerBody>
    <MpDrawerFooter>
      <div :class="filterDrawerFooterClass"><!-- space-between, full width -->
        <MpButton variant="ghost" @click="resetFilters">Reset</MpButton>
        <MpButton variant="primary" @click="isFilterDrawerOpen = false">Apply</MpButton>
      </div>
    </MpDrawerFooter>
  </MpDrawerContent>
</MpDrawer>
```

## Rules

- **Open state:** drive with `:is-open` + `@close` — this version emits `open`/`close`, **not** `update:isOpen`, so there is **no `v-model:is-open`**. `@close` covers the × button, overlay click, and Esc.
- **Close button placement:** `MpDrawerCloseButton` does **not** self-position — it must live **inside `MpDrawerHeader`** (a flex `space-between` container). As a bare sibling it drops to the top-left.
- **Header title size:** the header recipe sizes text at `md` (14px). Wrap the title in `<span :class="drawerTitleClass">` to bump it to **`lg` (16px)**; weight is inherited from the recipe.
- **Live or staged — decide by how many fields there are.**
  - **Live** (the template above): fields bind the page's own refs, so filtering
    happens as you type. `Apply` only closes; `Reset` clears the refs. Right for
    a handful of fields where each change is cheap and legible.
  - **Staged** (Purchases: [`PurchaseFilterDrawer.vue`](../../app/components/purchase/PurchaseFilterDrawer.vue)):
    the drawer edits a **local draft** and only `Apply` hands it to the page;
    `Cancel` discards. Switch to this once the set grows past a few fields, for
    two reasons. Re-running the list on every keystroke means most of the work
    happens behind an overlay the user can't see past — the result is a
    surprise when the drawer closes rather than feedback. And a live drawer
    makes `Cancel` and `Apply` decorative: neither does anything the other
    doesn't, so there is no way to back out of a half-built filter.
  - **A staged drawer owes the user two things a live one doesn't.** It closes
    over its own settings, so put a **dot on the Filter button** while anything
    is set, and a **Clear filters** action in the [`BlankSlate`](./BlankSlate.md) —
    otherwise a filter that matches nothing leaves an empty screen with no
    visible cause and no way out.
- Form fields are wrapped in `MpFormControl` + `MpFormLabel` — see [`Form`](./Form.md).

## Gotchas

- `placement="right"`, `size="sm"` for the filter use case. Larger forms can use `md`.
- The drawer fields and the quick filters bind the **same** state (see [`FilterBar`](./FilterBar.md)).
- **Not every field belongs on every tab.** Where the list has tabs over
  different record types, hide the controls that have no referent — Purchases
  drops the money ranges on Delivery and Request, the due-date range on both,
  and the tag picker on Join invoice. A control that can only ever match
  nothing reads as broken, which is worse than its absence.
- **`MpRadio` has no group wrapper in Pixel 3** — there is no `MpRadioGroup`.
  Radios are grouped by sharing one `v-model`; lay them out yourself in a flex
  row. Note that MpRadio was the first radio in this app, and Panda emits recipe
  CSS only for components it statically finds: the controls rendered as
  zero-height invisible boxes until `.nuxt` and `node_modules/.vite` were
  cleared. Expect that on the first use of any Pixel component.
